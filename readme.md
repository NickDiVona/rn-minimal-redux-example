# React-Native + Redux Starter Kit

---

## What is this:

The goal of this project is to create a template project for people studying how React and Redux work together.

This project is built in React-Native using Expo and can run on iOS, Android, or Web platforms. It was designed around the Web, so additional emulation software is not required.

---

## What you need:

This project should be done by those currently learning React or React-Native and thus have the proper environment set up to work with projects like this.

If you have stumbled upon this project and do not have anything installed, you'll have to download [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/). I recommend the LTS version.

## How to use:

Fork this project to have your own copy
**_or_**
Clone/Download this project to experiment without creating a new repository.

NodeJS comes with NPM, the Node Package Manager, but I personally prefer using Yarn for running projects.
To install Yarn, run the following:
`npm i -g yarn`

After that is installed, install the expo-cli by running the following:
`npm i -g expo-cli`

You can then clone this project, fork this project, or however you wish to get it.
From there, you'll need to navigate into the project folder and run the following command to install packages:
`yarn`

After that, the last step you'll need to do is run the start command. I would suggest adding a flag so it opens in the web client as well.
This command looks like this:
`yarn start -w`
